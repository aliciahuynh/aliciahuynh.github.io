Thought I'd write something up.

## A piece that was gathering dust on my desk

<center><img src='./assets/img/posts/20221018/poetry.jpg'></center>

So long my day\\
At peace I felt.\\
But alone I was,\\
And lonely drowning.\\

A breeze on my back,\\
A smile in my heart,\\
A touch at my tips,\\
The warmth in her gaze.\\

For the laughter ringing\\
Brought cotton in my head.\\
So heady was the high\\
And hollow I was left.\\


-- Yeah, it's not very good.
